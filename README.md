# stenobird
a wip, unnamed stenographic keyboard family.
currently in a heavy WIP stage, with the repository acting as simple VC over the yamls and PCBs

## Design Considerations
The stenobird family aims to provide a **choc-spaced** and **variably choc min spaced** 222222+3 layout for stenography and standard typing.
